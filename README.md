## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You must have the following software installed on your machine:
* Node.js (v18 or later)
* Git
* Docker Desktop

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create two environment files‚Äîone for the backend and one for the frontend.

    * In the `/backend` directory, create a `.env` file:
        ```env
        # A local PostgreSQL connection string
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name"

        # A strong secret key for signing JWTs
        JWT_SECRET="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_KEY_FOR_LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT"
        ```
    * In the `/frontend` directory, create a `.env.local` file:
        ```env
        # The URL of your local backend server
        VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
        ```

3.  **Run the Backend Server** (in one terminal window)
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create the database tables
    npx prisma migrate dev

    # Start the server
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Run the Frontend Application** (in a new terminal window)
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend directory
    cd frontend

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the development server
    npm run dev
    ```
The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified by Vite).
